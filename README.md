# connect_four

Connect four is a game similar to Tic Tac Toe. The game is played by two players, the players 
take turns dropping colored pieces down columns on a 7x6 board. The goal of the game is to 
align (connect) four of the same color pieces. A player can win by connecting
their four pieces either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
